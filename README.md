Legal Topic Classifier - Flask Web App
Description
"app.py" is the main script of my web application, which serves as a Legal Topic Classifier. The purpose of this application is to analyze input text and determine its legal topic based on a pre-trained Probabilistic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (PLDA) model. The model has been trained on a large dataset of legal texts and is capable of assigning topics to input text based on the most probable legal topic.

Upon receiving input text, the application preprocesses the text by removing any non-alphabetic characters and then passes it through the PLDA model to infer the topic. The model outputs a probability distribution over different legal topics, and the application selects the topic with the highest probability as the final classification.

The Legal Topic Classifier web app offers both a web interface and an API endpoint for easy integration with other applications. Users can input text through the web interface to receive instant topic classification results. Additionally, developers can leverage the API to integrate the classifier into their own applications and obtain topic predictions programmatically.

Overall, the Legal Topic Classifier aims to provide a convenient and efficient way to categorize legal text and assist legal professionals and researchers in organizing and analyzing vast amounts of legal information.

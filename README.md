# Legal Topic Classifier - Streamlit Web App

**Description:**

"app.py" is the main script of this web application, serving as a Hebrew-based Legal Topic Classifier. This application aims to analyze input text written in **Hebrew** and determine its legal topic using a pre-trained Probabilistic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (PLDA) model. The model has undergone training on an extensive dataset of Hebrew legal texts, enabling it to assign topics to Hebrew text based on the most probable legal topic.

**Transition to Streamlit:**

in order to set out a simple UI for inration purposes with the legal classifier recently I have transitioned this application from Flask to Streamlit, a powerful Python library for creating web apps for data science and machine learning. 

**Usage:**

To get started with the Legal Topic Classifier please go to https://legal-topic-classifier.streamlit.app/. 

**Note:** The Legal Topic Classifier is intended for experimental purposes only.
